This code shows the power of the internet checksum algorithm using a 3-bit word.
Code runs in MATLAB.

The default frame sizes start with L = 9 then incrementing by 3 till L = 21.
The iterations can be incremented but the ruining time will increase significantly.

The algorithm used in this code is a unique one not like the usual IP checksum.
This algorithm does not use 1s complement it uses modulus and stuff.

Anyone is free to use this code.
